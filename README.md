# Tardos Engine by Fukiyel  
### This project is about creating a basic 2D game engine with C++ using SDL2 and Code::Blocks.  
For now, the objective is to automatically scale sprites depending on their size, and on the window scale (320x180 being its base).

* `Create a window with a pre-defined size`
* `Display a Character with a pre-defined size and unique sprite`
